Spuds in Space
==============

Spuds in space is a shooting game built in JavaScript using Phaser game engine.

What is Phaser?
---------------

[Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) is a fast, free and fun open source game framework for making desktop and mobile browser HTML5 games. It uses [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) internally for fast 2D Canvas and WebGL rendering.

Requirements
------------

All you need to run the game is a webserver. Any will do just fine. I personally recommend Apache or Node.js.
